# One Love

## Description:
This project is a part of a Codecademy course, designed to demonstrate my skills utilizing the React library and my knowledge of interacting with external APIs within a Single Page Application (SPA) format. It showcases features such as user authentication, dynamic data fetching, and responsive design, leveraging technologies like React, JavaScript, CSS Modules, and HTML. The goal was to build a React web app with a focus on state management and API integration, providing a seamless user experience with real-time data interactions. Additionally, the project served as an opportunity to learn and apply testing practices using Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing, ensuring robust and reliable application behavior.
