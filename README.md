# One Love

## Description:
This project is a part of a Codecademy course, designed to showcase my skills utilizing the React library and my knowledge of interacting with external APIs within a Single Page Application (SPA) format. It demonstrates features such as user authentication, dynamic data fetching, and responsive design, leveraging technologies like React, Javascript, CSS Modules, and HTML. The goal was to build a React web app with a focus on state management and API integration, providing a seamless user experience with real-time data interactions.
